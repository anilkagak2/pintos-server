## thread.h

 introduced a new structure holding any open file' struct pointer it holds
	file descriptor too. Allocated independent to any other process.

	// structure for the file descriptor
	struct file_descriptor
	{
	  struct file *fp;              /* File structure. */
	  int fd;                       /* File Descriptor. */
	  struct list_elem elem;        /* Element for inserting this into thread's
		                                descriptor list. */
	};

 a new structure to get rid of some restrictions put in exit syscall, now a
	process puts it's exit status on parent's this struct when its exits.
	Even any accidental killing of child will ensure to put the exit
	status there

	// structure for storing child information
	struct child_info
	{
	  struct thread *child;         /* Child's struct thread*. */
	  tid_t tid;                    /* Child's thread id. */
	  int return_value;             /* Return value for the child. */
	  struct list_elem elem;        /* Hanger for hanging on children list. */
	};


 changed the 'struct thread' structure (in addition to the changes
		done in part 1)
	#ifdef USERPROG
	    int ret_value;                      /* Return value for the thread. */
	    struct semaphore child_sema;        /* Semaphore for synchronization with process_wait for children. */
	    struct semaphore parent_sema;       /* Parent tries to down this semaphore for wait syscall. */
	    struct list children;               /* List of all the children of the thread. */
	    struct list_elem child_elem;        /* To insert in the parent's children list. */
	    struct thread *parent;              /* Parent's thread pointer. */
	    struct list fd_list;                /* List of file descriptors of thread.*/
	    int fd_to_allot;                    /* File descriptor number to be allotted. */
	#endif

## syscall.h
 Lock for accessing the file system code as it should be treated as a Critical
	Section (as per pintos.pdf). Now file system code can be accessed only
	by thread exclusively holding this lock. Lock will be released by the 
	exit syscall, if the thread gets killed too.

	struct lock filesys_lock;

--	ALGORITHMS

 1) Argument Passing
	process_execute() parses the arguments given to it as commandline to
	execute via cmd_token(). cmd_token tokenizes the commandline, treating
	space as the delimiting character.
	newly created process is passed this argv, argc pair. The process
	starts at start_process which setup the stack once the executable is
	loaded. Setting up the stack takes place via copying the argv
	parameters in the process's stack, aligning the stack pointer, placing
	the pointers to the copied parameters with a NULL parameter being
	argv[argc], placing the argc parameter & finally placing a fake return
	address. Argv pointers are placed in the order argc -> 0.

 2) User Memory Access
	for every user pointer, call check_pointer() which in turn calls
	is_pointer_valid(). is_pointer_valid() returns false if user pointer
	is NULL or else if it is not a valid user virtual address or else if it is
	not mapped to page table of the current thread otherwise it returns
	true.

 3) Syscall Handler
	syscall_handler extracts the syscall number & other parameters from
	the user stack & perform the appropriate operation for the system call.
	Wherever the syscall returns some value, that value is placed in the
	eax field of the interrupt frame given to syscall_handler as parameter
	
	Following cases are handled
	> SYS_HALT
		- simply calls power_off() which immediately shut's down the computer

	> SYS_EXIT
		- calls exit_handler() with the return status extracted from
		  the user stack. exit_handler frees all the resources
		  allocated to the process (fd_list, locks_holding,etc.),
		  places the return status in the parent's semaphore & the exits via calling
		  thread_exit

	> SYS_EXEC
		- calls process_execute() with commandline given as argument

	> SYS_WAIT
		- extracts the thread id from the stack & call process_wait()

	> SYS_CREATE
		- calls filesys_create() with file name & initial size
		  extracted from stack

	> SYS_REMOVE
		- calls filesys_remove() with file name
	
	> SYS_OPEN
		- calls open_handler with the name of the file to open as
		  argument. open_handler opens the file via calling
		  filesys_open(), allocates memory for the file descriptor
		  struct & store the filesys_open's returned struct file* in it & allocate a
		  file descriptor number to it.

	> SYS_FILESIZE
		- calls file_length() with struct file* after extracting it
		  from  file descriptor (searching in the fd_list)

	> SYS_READ
		- reads from keyboard via input_getc() if file descriptor is
		  STDIN_FILENO, else it searches the fd_list for fd & uses file_read to
		  read into the buffer given as parameter

	> SYS_WRITE
		- writes to console via calling put_buf() with buffer as
		  argument else it outputs to the file via file_write () with
		  appropriate parameters

	> SYS_SEEK
		- calls file_seek after extracting the file struct for it

	> SYS_TELL
		- calls file_tell on the file struct

	> SYS_CLOSE
		- calls give_fdescriptor () which gives the pointer to struct file descriptor
		  & then closes the file with file_close (), removes fd from fd_list
		  & free the memory allocated to the file descriptor

	Apart from the above changes, a process makes it executable read only
	till the time it is runnig by calling file_deny_write() on it.

	Any page fault caused by user process, calls exit_handler on it with
	exit status -1.

--	SYNCHRONIZATION

  File System Access
	Every file system code is accessed only after acquiring filesys_lock,
	as the filesys code is treated as Critical Section.

  Process exec, wait & exit
	process_execute() waits till the start_process load's the executable,
	by calling sema_down() on the semaphore embedded in the kargv given as
	parameter to the start_process. After start_process returns from load,
	it puts the return status in the kargv & calls sema_up() on the embedded
	semaphore.

	process_wait() searches it's children_list for a child with given
	thread id. If child is found in the list, it checks whether the child
	(struct thread *) is valid or not (initialized to the child's thread *) in 
	init_thread(). If child is NULL, then it returns the return_status
	stored by child (on syscall exit) & frees up the resource allocated
	to the chils's struct ichild & removes it from children_list, else it waits
	on child by calling sema_down() on child's parent_sema. If given tid is not a
	child of parent, it returns -1.

	exit_handler places the return status in parent's ichild struct &
	calls sema_up on it's parent_sema semaphore & makes parent's ichild->child =
	NULL used in process_wait

--	INITIALIZATIONS

## thread.c
 - init_thread ()
	- initialize semaphores child_sema & parent_sema for the thread
	- initialize the children list of the thread (children)
	- initialize thread's file descriptor list (fd_list)
	- initialize the fd_to_allot as 2 (Leaving 0,1 for STDIN, STDOUT)
		currently the fd_list doesn't contain the entry for STDIN &
		STDOUT (if required in future it can be added)
	- initialize the thread's parent pointer if it's not the initial
		thread (because the init thread has no parent)
	- if the current thread is not the main thread, then insert it's list_elem
		in it's parent's children list, as main thread has no parent

 - thread_create ()
	- allocate_tid () needs to be executed after init_thread () only but why (??)
	- so for adding the child_info struct (ichild) to parent's children
		list you need to allocate memory for that struct & initialize it
		only after allocate_tid () is called.
	- initialize the ichild's tid, thread struct with that of child, keep
		return value as 0 (default)
	- add the child to parent's children list

## syscall.c                                                                        
 - syscall_init ()
	- initialize the filesys_lock


--	FUNCTIONS ADDED & CHANGED
	THEIR LOGIC ALONG WITH THE APPRORIATE SYCHRONIZATION

## process.c

static char **
cmd_token (char *cmdline, void *aux)
	- breaks the cmdline into a char *argv[] like array, aux is added to the 
		last of the list before NULL
	- this function is called from	process_execute () & that function
		has to wait till the new process loads it's executable & hence
		need some kind of semaphore
	- this aux is a struct semaphore* casted into void pointer & added to
		the argv[] for sending the argument to the child process &
		then parent process will try to down this semaphore

## process.c
## functions changed
tid_t
process_execute (const char *cmd_line)
	- this function creates a new thread for executing the cmd_line
	- it breaks the command string into a C commandline argv[] array
	- this function should wait till the newly created thread loads it's
		  executeable & hence sema is used
	- if thread_create () was successful then wait on the semaphore
		which will be sema_up()'d by the child thread after load ()
		returns & child returns the load()'s return value in kargv[0]
		which was passed to it in thread_create()
	- if child was unsuccessful in loading it's executeable then kargv[0]
		will be false


static void
start_process (void *kargv)
	- apart from the initial functioning
	- check whether kargv is valid or not
	- cast it to char ** argv[] array
	- count the number of arguments given for extracting the semaphore
		embedded inside the argv[], extract it & decrease the argc by 1
	- also opens it's own executable & denies writes to it via calling 
		file_deny_write ()
	- process_execute () wait on this function till it gives the load ()'s
		return value to it & that function in terms is called by exec
		syscall while holding the filesys lock so no need to acquire
		lock for filesys lock here**
	- after loading the executeable for the thread in memory setup the
		stack
	- Copy all the strings on the stack using memcpy (), then check for
		the alignment of the stack pointer (as it is accessed as a
		4byte entity)
	- Put argv[argc] = NULL as per the C Standards
	- Then place the pointers to the argv[]'s in reverse order i.e. starting at
		argc-1 till 0 (stored in the offset[]s which were initialized while
		copying the strings)
	- Finally put &argv (&argv[0]) on the stack,then argc & a fake return address 
		as the thread will start executing the main code after
		returning from this function, actually it is simulated as if
		the system came out of an interrupt & the process before interrupt was
		stored in intr_frame if & hence main code starts executing
	- After this setup call the signal the parent thread by sema_up() on
		the semaphore given to it in argv[] & placing the load's
		return value in argv[0]


int
process_wait (tid_t child_tid)
	- called by a thread for waiting on a child process (child_tid)
	- this time i've changed the children list in it's structure,
		previously, it's entry may be invalid as it contained the
		list_elem of child (which becomes invalid once the child exits)
		so to remove it struct child_info is introduced, it's
		dynamically allocated & destroyed on thread's exit.
	- searches in the current thread's children list for the presence of
		child_tid, if found then wait till the completion of the
		child by calling sema_down () on child's parent_semaphore,
		else return -1(as there is some problem in waiting for this thread)
	- returns -1 in case child is not found in the children list


## syscall.c

void
syscall_init (void)
	- initializes the filesys_lock

bool
is_ptr_valid (void *ptr)
	- checks the validity of user provided addresses
	- returns true only if ptr is not NULL & if it's a user virtual address
		& if it is available in page directory of the thread
	

void
check_pointer (void *ptr)
	- handles the problem of calling is_ptr_valid () on ptr &
		call exit_handler(-1) if ptr is invalid
	

struct child_info *
get_parents_child_info ()
	- searches the parent's children list for it's own child_info
		struct, if found it returns that, otherwise returns NULL
	- this function only reads the parent's child struct doesn't 
		modify it
int
open_handler (const char *file_name)
	- helper function for the open system call
	- this function is called after acquiring the filesys_lock
	- it opens the file & allocates a new struct file descriptor
		through malloc & fills the fields & pushes it to the
		fd_list for future access


struct file *
search_fd_list (int fd)
	- searches the thread's fd_list for the presence of fd,
		if found returns the struct file* for it
		else return NULL


struct file_descriptor *
give_fdescriptor (int fd)
	- searches the thread's fd_list for the presence of fd,
		if found returns the struct file_descriptor* for it
		else return NULL


void
exit_handler (int ret_value)
	- hepler function for exit system call
	- also useful in check_pointer () for exiting the call
	- closes all the file descriptors & removes them from the fd_list
	- also releases all the locks which the thread holds
	- Need to pass the info to the parent thread
		Previously it was done like this
		need to wait till the parent process extracts the exit status
		otherwise on calling thread_exit() function the thread
		structure will get destroyed & then parent cannot extract the
		information out of the it.
		Also the list_elem child_elem in the parent's children list
		should be removed.
		Current thread signal's parent by calling sema_up () on it's
		parent_semaphore & wait's on parent's child_semaphore by
		sema_down () on it (accessible by the parent pointer)
		Finally after synchornizing with parent & passing the exit code(with
		the help of ret_value field), call thread_exit ().

		But this implementation created some critical problems like 
		thread exiting before parent waits under some cases (like one 
		in syn-read), so instead ichild was introduced & thread puts
		return value there & parent extracts return value from there
		& this thread exits irrespective of waiting for parent to know
		the return status (uselessly wasting CPU cycles in sema_down
		(&child_sema) ).


static void
syscall_handler (struct intr_frame *f)
	- interrupt handler for the internal interrupt (vector no. 0x30)
	- called when a process calls any of the syscalls given in <syscall.h>
	- given the intr_frame for the internal interrupt so that we can
		extract the parameters passed for the system function call
		available on the calling process's system stack
	- extract the stack pointer(esp) of the calling thread with the help
		of the intr_frame
	- check the pointers for their validity by check_pointer(), which
		calls exit_handler if the pointer is invalid
	- pop the syscall number from the stack pointed by user_esp
	- check against the syscall numbers defined in <syscall-nr.h>
	- then handling the case against which the syscall_no matches
	- all the file system code is accessed after acquiring the filesys
		lock
	- in system calls where return value is required, it stores the return
		 value on f->eax
	- Following cases are handled(as of now, tests cases are nunning for
		them):
	> SYS_HALT
		- no parameters needed
		- simply calls power_off() which immediately shut's down the computer

	> SYS_EXIT
		- exit status needs to be extracted
		- calls exit_handler () with the return status

	> SYS_EXEC
		- needs the commandline to be executed
		- extracts the commandline & checks for it's validity
		- if valid then calls process_execute() & stores the return 
			value in frame's eax field, which will be given to the
			thread on returning from this interrupt handler

	> SYS_WAIT
		- needs thread id as a parameter
		- extracts the thread id from the stack & call process_wait ()
			with this thread id
		
	> SYS_CREATE
		- need a file name to be created & it's initial size as a parameters
		- extracts them & calls filesys_create ()

	> SYS_REMOVE
		- need a file name to be removed as a parameter 
		- extracts it & calls filesys_remove ()
	
	> SYS_OPEN
		- extracts the argument file name from stack & calls
			open_handler while holding the lock
		- release the lock after the open_handler returns

	> SYS_FILESIZE
		- search the file descriptor in the fd_list of thread
			if found calls file_length () on the file struct

	> SYS_READ
		- need file descriptor(from where to read), buffer(to which
			it'll be read) & length of the buffer as a parameters
		- checks the validity of the buffer
		- if fd is  STDIN_FILENO, it read from keyboard with
			input_getc ()
		- else it searches the fd_list for fd & uses file_read to read
			into the buffer given as parameter

	> SYS_WRITE
		- need file descriptor(where to output), buffer(to output)
			& length of the buffer as a parameters
		- checks the validity of the buffer
		- if fd is STDOUT_FILENO, it calls put_buf ()
		- else it outputs to the file via file_write () with
			appropriate parameters

	> SYS_SEEK
		- need file descriptor & file position (where to put the read head)
		- calls file_seek after extracting the file struct for it

	> SYS_TELL
		- need file descriptor (of which the position is to be
			displayed)
		- calls file_tell on the file struct

	> SYS_CLOSE
		- need the file descriptor to close
		- calls give_fdescriptor () which gives the pointer to the
			place where it lies
		- then close the file with file_close (), remove from fd_list
			this pointer's list_elem & free this memory

## thread.c
void
thread_exit (void)
	- apart from the initial functioning, it also deletes the
		children list & frees the memory allocated to it via
		malloc


--	RATIONALE

	- There is a trade-off between the simple implementation of
 	  check_pointer () & the huge number of places where
	  it's been called, instead the other solution for
	  pointer validity checking as given in the book is to
	  handle the page fault.
 	  That will be much less of headache but will be
	  somewhat complex, i'll do that some time later

	- Is there really any need of having parent pointer in the
 	  thread structure ?? Otherwise any process can
	  mislead the parent & create some problems.
	  Need to think over it.

	- Initial (main) thread calls process_execute without holding
 	  filesys_lock but start_process uses file_deny_write ()
 	  & open_handler () (both access filesys code with acquiring
	  the lock). Any user process accesses the filesys code
	  after acquiring the lock but the kernel processes do
	  not follow this strategy. This may create problems in
	  future. What can be done ??
